# OAuthLogin
Swift App Using OAuth2 Authentication
This is a Swift app that utilizes OAuth2 authentication for user login and access to protected resources. OAuth2 is a widely-used protocol for authorization and authentication of web and mobile applications. The app provides a secure way for users to log in to the application by authorizing a third-party service to access their personal data.

Requirements
To run this app, you will need the following software installed on your machine:

Xcode 12 or later
Swift 5.0 or later
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/iAyushMishra/OAuthLogin.git
Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the .xcodeproj file.
Install any required dependencies using pods
Build and run the app on a simulator or connected iOS device.
Usage
Launch the app on your device or simulator.
The app will present a login screen. Tap the "Login with OAuth2" button to begin the authentication process.
The app will redirect you to a web page to enter your credentials and authorize the app to access your data.
After successful authentication, the app will retrieve an access token from the OAuth2 server and use it to authorize requests for protected resources.
Once authenticated, the user will be able to access protected resources within the app.
